# AGiliTy

Windows AGiliTy is an interpreter for the old Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT). Although considered outdated and little used these days, AGT was popular in the late 1980s, and a community centered around Compuserve (a commercial bulletin board system popular before the Internet really took off) wrote a large number of games with it. Of these games some are still well worth playing, such as Compuserve and Shades of Gray.

Windows AGiliTy is a port of Robert Masenten's AGiliTy, a reverse engineered interpreter that can play games produced with any of the many versions of AGT.
