<h1>Differences from the Original AGT Interpreters</h1>
<ul>
<li>Disambiguation is done on the normal command entry line rather than having a special prompt.
<li>When asked "Which object do you mean?", it is possible to reply ANY, EITHER, BOTH, or ALL, as well as giving the name of an object.
<li>LISTEXIT ON, LISTEXIT OFF will turn automatic listing of exits on or off (in AGT there is a LIST EXITS command, so some AGT games don't list exits to rooms).
<li>OOPS, UNDO, and RESTART are supported (at least on systems with enough memory).
<li>Adjective-only matches are accepted by the parser.
<li>The parser is capable of intelligent disambiguation. 
<li>It is also able to expand ALL and ALL EXCEPT (when appropriate options are set).
<li>Some more multiple word verbs are automatically recognized (for example, GET IN is automatically translated into ENTER).
<li>Some built-in verbs have additional synonyms. (In particular, standard one-letter abbreviations are supported: X for EXAMINE, Z for WAIT)
<li>Game-specific synonyms are given a higher priority by the parser than the generic built-in synonyms.
<li>The standard error messages are different than the original (except in Master's Edition games where most of the standard error messages are included in the game file)
<li>SCRIPT output is sent to a file rather than to the printer.
<li>AGiliTy has an extended AGILDEBUG debugging verb and supports more detailed metacommand tracing output.  
<li>AGiliTy uses a different save file format.  
<li>COLORS is not supported, although on some systems equivalent functionality may be supported in the configuration file.
<li>The special title screen effects of the <b>Shades of Gray</b> and <b>Cosmoserve97</b> interpreters aren't duplicated.
<li>Graphics, sound, and fonts are not supported on all platforms.</ul>
