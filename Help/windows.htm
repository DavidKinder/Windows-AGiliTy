AGiliTy supports input line editing and history to make typing more convenient. All the common editing keys work as you would
expect. Cursor up and cursor down step up and down through the input history, respectively. Text can be pasted into the input
line using the standard paste keys (i.e. Ctrl+v or Shift+Insert).
<p>
This Windows port of the AGiliTy Interpreter behaves as you would expect of a Windows program: to operate use either the menus or
the toolbar. The only section requiring explanation is the <b>Options</b> dialog. The settings available in this dialog are:
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td nowrap width="200" valign=top>Fix window at 80 columns</td>
    <td>If this option is set, then whenever a new game is loaded AGiliTy will attempt to resize the window so that the display
is exactly 80 columns across. Some games require this for their text to appear correctly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap width="200" valign=top>Enable colours</td>
    <td>If this is set, then the colours are taken from the four colour well gadgets immediately below. If it is not set,
the standard Windows fore and background colours are used.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
