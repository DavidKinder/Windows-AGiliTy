<h1>AGiliTy: The (mostly) universal AGT interpreter</h1>
<h2>Version 1.1.2<br>
Written by Robert Masenten<br>
Windows version by David Kinder</h2>

This is an interpreter for game files created with Malmberg and Welch's <b>Adventure Game Toolkit</b>. AGiliTy is universal in the sense
that it understands and interprets most of the many versions of the AGT game file format (unlike the original interpreters which
were only intended to run the game file format associated with them) and also in that it is written in ANSI C and so should be
straightforward to port to other systems.  
<p>
It is <b>not</b> a port of the original interpreters but rather a completely new interpreter built around the game file format; while it
follows the original interpreters on most things, there are some differences which are described below.
