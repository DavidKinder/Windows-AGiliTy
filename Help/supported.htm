<h1>AGT Versions Supported</h1>
AGiliTy understands the following versions of AGT (which includes every AGT game at www.ifarchive.org that I know of):
<ul>
<li>1.0
<li>1.18
<li>The early "Classic AGT": e.g. 1.19, 1.2, 1.21
<li>"Classic AGT", both big and small: e.g. 1.3, 1.32, 1.35, 1.5, 1.7
<li>The "Even Bigger 1.32" used by <b>Cosmoserve</b>
<li>The "Chemically Altered 1.32" used by <b>Shades of Gray</b>
<li>Menichelli's 1.82 [untested] and 1.83
<li>Both known "proto-Master's Edition" 1.5 variants
<li>The proto-Master's Edition 1.6 variant used by <b>Pork</b>
<li>Both Master's Edition 1.0 variants
<li>The Master's Edition 1.5/1.51, 1.55, and 1.56/1.6/1.7
</ul>
<b>The Pyramids of Mars</b> and <b>Cliff Diver</b> require configuration options to be set; they use variant interpreters that are
supported but can't be detected by the interpreter. In particular, <b>Pyramids</b> needs the ALT_ANY option and <b>Cliff Diver</b>
requires the IRUN option.
<p>
<b>Klaustrophobia</b> is now supported. Use AGiliTy to play each of the chapters as usual. To switch between chapters, just SAVE at
the end of one chapter and RESTORE at the beginning of the next (the game will tell you when to switch chapters; however, use SAVE
instead of DONE1 or DONE2). This is still experimental and so I'd appreciate any feedback on how well it works (or doesn't work,
as the case may be). 
<p>
Unlike the MS-DOS programs that <b>Klaustrophobia</b> originally used for this, AGiliTy doesn't check that you've actually reached
the end of the previous chapter; be warned that if you switch chapters before the game tells you to, things may break.
<p>
There is also no way for AGiliTy to support the intermission or endgame text from the original game: these are all printed out by
DOS programs rather than by the AGT interpreter.
