<h1>List of Changes since Version 0.1</h1>
Changes for Version 1.1.1
<ul>
<li>Fixed output function: paragraph filling corrected; made filling
less agressive for Magx games; fixed print_statline to work with a
screen width greater than 100.
<li>Object loops more carefully trapped, avoiding infinite loops. Object
loop error no longer printed out.
<li>IsWorn and IsCarried no longer look inside closed objects. [Al]
<li>Fixed handling of AGT_DEBUG_CMD by agt_newgame(). [Kinder]
<li>*nix port changes: MORE handling fixed; os_linux.c renamed os_termcap.c;
os_curses.c is now the main *nix interface; os_curses version of fix_loc()
fixed; os_curses batch support fixed.
<li>32-Bit DOS port: BIOS option now works.
<li>Fixed formatting in debugger object editor.
</ul>
Changes for Version 1.1
<ul>
<li>The interpreter will now work correctly when passed an AGT file
name with an extension (instead of trying to read it as an AGX file).
<li>Overhauled STANDARD message handling: ATTACK messages will now get
the $noun$ and $object$ in the right order; parser messages now
replaceable; $noun$-type substitutions are prevented in cases where
they are not meaningful; added message fallback system to stdmsg();
added '-s' command line option for debugging standard messages; added
$the_name$, $name_pro$, $name_indir$; fixed capitalization of proper
$name$s; $/# substitution routines simplified.
<li>Debugger now supports objprops, objflags, and PROPER.
<li>New metacommand tokens: CanGo and MoveInDirection.
<li>Added support for printing objprops and objflags.
<li>Added support for itemized objprops/variables/objflags/flags.
<li>Added support for explicit objects to redirection and command
headers.
<li>Null NOUN/OBJECT/ACTOR args to conditional tokens will no longer
generate GAME ERROR messages.
<li>Added $ and # expansion to shortdescs of nouns and creatures.
<li>Misc bug fixes:initialization of seen and proper for original AGT games;
types in GAME ERROR messages; objswap in exec_verb(); parse_noun will
no longer look for multiple nouns when parsing the actor; possible 
buffer overrun in wordcode_match; added second line of vb== conditions
to verify_scope.
<li>Overhauled handling of dobj_rec, iobj_rec, actor_rec: they
are now copied and freed by runverbs() and objcheck_cycle();
added copy_parserec(), free_all_parserec();
<li>Fixed e-mail address and Jay's URL.
</ul>
Changes for Version 1.0
<ul>
<li>Added support for proper names of creatures and nouns, indicated
by the object in question having the PROPER flag set.  Proper names
are printed capitalized and without the definite article ("Fred"
instead of "the fred"). Note that this change only affects built-in
messages, and game messages that use the new $the_n$, $the_o$, and
$the_c$ substitutions.
<li>As part of this change, added the PROPER_CREATURE configuration
option which will make *all* creature names proper.
<li>For pre-Magx games, built-in verb synonyms now take precedence
over author-defined ones. For example, N will now be interpretered as
NORTH, even in games that try to redefine it as meaning "NO".  (Games
created using VERSION MAGX will still honor the author's intent.)
<li>PLAY WITH is longer automatically converted to PLAY. [Metcalf]
<li>TURN ON can now trigger specials [Metcalf]; in general, the
handling of &lt;verb&gt; &lt;preposition&gt; &lt;noun&gt; constructions for pre-Magx
games has been fixed.
<li>Items contained in worn objects are now also considered to be worn.
<li>Short description used instead of adjective-noun for nested
inventory items. [Metcalf]
<li>Fixed problem with empty filenames in get_user_file.
<li>$ strings no longer forced to lower case before substitution.  
<li>32-bit DOS version now supports graphics and fonts.

requirements.
</ul>
Changes for Version 0.9.1
<ul>
<li>Fixed reading of Master's Edition games, which was broken by the
roomflag changes in 0.9.
</ul>
Changes for Version 0.9
<ul>

the official limit on number of roomflags to 31. [Mlinar]
<li>KillPlayer now ends metacommand execution. [Jay]
<li>DescribeThing &lt;room&gt; now works correctly. [Tarkin]
<li>Disambiguation of GET fixed to deal with containers. [Turpin]
<li>Fixed conflict between autoexec verbs and AFTER. [Turpin]

<ul>
<li>DOS binary recompiled with correct source files.
<li>Fixed AGX incompatibility problem with pre-0.8.8 interpreters.
Standard AGX version raised to 2.

new metacommand tokens ObjFlagOn, ObjFlagOff, TurnObjFlagOn, TurnObjFlagOff,
ToggleObjFlag, PushObjProp, and PopObjProp.  
<li>Action tokens that only affect the stack no longer force then end of
an OR block. (This allows the stack to be used for computations in such a 
block.)
<li>Changed names of IsSet/Set/Clear to AttrOn/TurnAttrOn/TurnAttrOff.
<li>Two-argument metacommand tokens now work correctly with NOUN and OBJECT.
<li>Two-argument metacommands with a double top-of-stack reference now
pops the second argument first.
<li>Fixed handling of NOUNInRoom, DescribeThing, and EndDisambig tokens.
<li>Fixed 16-bit overflow bug in loadgame(). [Tarkin]

adjectives, object.c problems with creatureless games, agtout display
of non-printable owner-ids, BeforeCommand/AfterCommand handling during
disambiguation, premature closing of the description file in agt2agx
(giving a "Bad file number" error under DOS), DOS memory allocation
error ("Failed Assertion: size>=0" when loading games with 500 or more
nouns), and a couple of typos in game messages.
<li>Fixed PUSH error message handling and compute_addr diagnostics
[Patch submitted by Paul Mikell].
<li>Addition of quitflag tests in a few places [Patch contributed by
Mitch Mlinar].
</ul>
Changes for Version 0.8.6
<ul>
<li>Added NAVARROW configuration option to Linux and DOS version,
which allows the arrow keys to be used for navigation instead of editing.  
<li>Added PURE_AFTER configuration option. (This affects whether LOOKs
occur before or after AFTER commands.)

been replace by "genfile" and all uses of the game name have been
replaced by 'file context' elements. 
<li>Miscellaneous fixes: bold text in the DOS port should now be the
right color; use of 'class' and 'new' was eliminated from the source
code to avoid conflict with C++; eliminated error message when title
file not found; disambiguation now correctly accounts for two-cycle
execution; fixed bug in rsort() so it can deal with multiple
RedirectTo headers; tweaked concdup(); started adding hint data
structures; handling of user strings fixed.

metacommand overriding LOOK &lt;object>).  [Y16] 
<li>Global noun handling fixed: EXAMINING one now gives a sensible
message and $adjective$ handling has been fixed to deal with them. [Y10&11]
<li>SHOOT will now treat a lone object as the target if it is not
shootable.  [Y6] 
<li>Eliminated internal error caused by "TALK" with no object. [Y7]
<li>Trace output now prints out metacommand adjective match fields.
<li>Redirection turns off checking for excess objects under certain
conditions. [Y4/17]

correct times; SendTreasureToRoom and IsCarryingTreasure, THROW/AFTER
synonyms, BLOCK_HOSTILE, and noun.position are fixed; SHOW prints a more
reasonable default error message; fixed the error message printed when
ALL doesn't refer to anything; sorting of actor metacommands is now

</ul>
Changes for Version 0.6
<ul>
<li>Added support for Klaustrophbia's multiple game files and save files
from previous versions of the same game.
<li>Added INTRO verb to reprint the introduction of the game.
<li>The introduction will now wait for you to hit any key before continuing.
<li>Pronouns are now assigned to the last direct object in preference
to the last indirect object.
<li>agt_save(), agt_restore(), agt_newgame(), and agt_quit() added for

and creatures, and processing of $your$.
</ul>
Changes for Version 0.5
<ul>
<li>Added support for new "AGX" file format, in agxfile.c; a new set
of file manipulation routines have been added to rmem.c to support the
format. There is a new pAGX #define for the extension of the new format.
<li>Save and restore were rewritten to use the same file I/O code as the
AGX routines; savefmt.h no longer exists. This seems to have fixed the
bug with RESTART and UNDO overwriting the dictionary under DOS.
<li>Save, restore, script, and log files now add an extension automatically.
<li>Both the interpreter and agttest.c have been modified slightly to
work with the new file format and a new program, agt2agx, has been
added to convert AGT files to the AGX format.
<li>To support the new format, the TTL and INS routines in agil.c have
been rewritten.
<li>The interpreter now waits until there is something on the status
line before printing it out.
<li>Extensions to the debugger: roomflags now can be viewed and
modified; so can the gender field of creatures and user strings;
formatting of output has been improved(thanks to Jay Goemmer's
suggestions); main debugging menu reorganized; can now turn
tracing of disambiguaion and of ANY verbs off; metacommand trace now
prints out actors and REDIR instead of cryptic numbers to represent
the first field of the command header.
<li>dbg_nomsg added so messages will only be printed once when tracing
metacommands rather than twice. 
<li>The function init_interface() has been replace by two functions,
init_interface() and start_interface();
<li>Split exec.c into exec.c and object.c
<li>Added a new file, agilstub.c, which needs to be linked with the
non-interpreter utilities.
<li>File read/write routines now do more comprehensive error checking.
<li>AMIGA and HP-UX configurations have been added to the header
(thanks to David Kinder and Alexander Lehmann) 
<li>Boxes under the DOS interface are now in reverse video.
<li>Fixed reading of CFG file so SLASH_BOLD would work.
<li>All agtread output now goes through rprintf and from there through
writestr and writeln. DIAG now defaults to 0 so there should be less
output to begin with.
<li>Added fix_ascii_flag and IBM_CHAR option which allow the decision
about character translation to be made at run time.
<li>Made a lot more limits dynamically set, including the number flags,
variables, counters, dummy verbs, and subroutines;
<li>LookAtRoom now prints the room description directly, rather than waiting
until the end of the turn.
<li>Object lists are now sorted by object number, so they will maintain
a consistent ordering.
<li>Changed handling of REPLACE_WORD so it will also replace synonyms.
<li>Line break section of writestr() rewritten to fix a couple of bugs
and os_dos.c has been fixed to get rid of extra line breaks.
<li>The 1.5/F decoding of the DA2 file has been fixed so _The
Multi-dimensional Thief_ should now work. 
<li>Bugs fixed: exits now printed correctly by debugger; a few
spelling errors fixed; YesNo and Chance bug; maxpix, maxpict, etc. are
now converted to zero if they are negative; UserStrings now numbered
from 1..25 rather than 0..24; fixed centering of status line; AFTER
commands not scanned after GameEnd token anymore. 
<li>Eliminated extra newline in Linux script files.
<li>Fixed bug in os_linux.c, agt_option(), that caused it to report an
error with COLORTERM  
<li>General cleaning up of the code: picture/sound/font filenames are
now stored in the main static string array; several redundant
variables eliminated; read_descr() rewritten to work with new file
format; eliminated distinction between regular and auxilary verbs;
added get_opdef(); 
<li>Moved most of the purity flags from uagt.h/agil.c to
agtread.h/agtdata.c, so they would be visible to agxfile.c.
<li>ReDirect now marked by a flip in sign instead of adding 2000;
ANYBODY has been moved to 2 from 123; and &lt;no actor&gt; is now
represented by 1 instead of 0 (so it can be negated).
<li>Replace fixchar() and IBM character set translations by a look-up
table to speed up reading of descriptions.
<li>Tweaked room description printing so SPECIALS that send you to the same
room don't cause the room description to be printed out again.
<li>For Master's Edition games, now set have_meta flag based on
last_cmd rather than on the value in the DA1 file (which is always
true for ME games even if there are no metacommands).
<li>Made several int data type more specific and made sure they were consistent
with the corresponding save/restore/AGX file types.
<li>Rewrote readnum() in agtread.c
<li>Moved dictionary diagnostic stuff into a separate routine, which 	
we can call from agttest.

<li>Prompt is now bold as well as input text.
<li>Added synonyms: 'inv' as synonym for 'inventory'; 'in' and 'inside'
as synonyms for 'enter'  
<li>Classic version 1.0 is now supported as is the version used by
Cosmoserve 97, and the 1.5 variants used by Hotel Notell and The
Multidimensional Thief.
<li>The status line is now updated every time the player's location changes.
<li>Version 1.83 now properly recognized even if there are no creatures.  
<li>Titles in v1.83 are no longer automatically centered (to conform with
the original interpreter). 
<li>Split metacommand.c into metacommand.c and token.c
<li>The contents of variables are now type-checked; fixed type output

<li>Rewrote the type checking system to be more precise
<li>DEBUG_AGT_CMD is now equivelent to flag[0].
<li>rmalloc, rrealloc trap errors if too large a block is requested
(determined by MAXSTRUCT).  
<li>Rewrote color code to avoid collision of color tokens with '\t' and
remapped the 1.83 '\' bold character.
<li>Moved terminal tokens up to code 2000, to make it easier to add new
tokens.
<li>Code reorganization: moved concdup() from agtdata.c to rmem.c, making
it public; reorganized file code in agtread.c and rmem.c; removed
underline translator in tokeniser; rewrote fix_cmd; reorganized memory
allocation in agtread.c to reduce fragmentation; added 'static' to a
lot of declarations and reduced external linkage requirement to 8
characters;  rfree macro rewritten; word lists("slists") now stored
dynamically; opcode name list uses pointers instead of fixed length
arrays. 
<li>Fixed various bugs: various problems with PUT IN; ME/1.0 pictures,
fonts,songs, and user strings ignored; cosmetic errors in
print_contents; dictionary search case senstitive; various problems
with INVISIBLE; 1.83 games crashed; ANYBODY not properly matched.
</ul>
Changes for Version 0.2
<ul>
<li>The save file format has shrunk.
<li>Fixed print_title() to do IBM character translation for the title file.
<li>RESTORE now verifies that save files are from the correct game.
<li>Added support for version 1.18 games.
<li>Metacommand debugging information now goes throught the standard
screen output routines.

a hash table for search_dict().
<li>When program finds a lot of bad tokens it no longer floods the screen
with warning messages
<li>OR metacommand tokens are now handled consitently with the original
interpreters. 
<li>Reorganized exec.c into three files: exec.c, runverb.c, and metacommand.c
and a header exec.h
<li>DEBUG_OUT is now defined in uagt.h.
<li>Completed internal support for fonts, music, and graphics. Of
course these still require a port actually capable of using of this.
<li>Rewrote file size functions to be more portable; eliminated NO_FILESIZE
and REPLACE_FILESIZE
<li>Added FAST_SETSIGN, using macros to speed this up on compatible systems.
<li>Got rid of HUGE #defines; any individual data structure now fits in 64k
<li>Changed print_obj() to not print out an object's short description if it
starts with INVISIBLE even if it contains other words.
<li>Changed MEM_MARGIN to 16k which should prevent the interpreter from
starting up without enough memory and then dying mid-game.
<li>Changed the way noun.position is handled to reduce the size of save
files.
<li>Cleaned up DA1 reading routines in agtread.c and aver encoding.
<li>'long int' and 'short int' changed to 'long' and 'short' to allow

<li>Cleaned up BRIEF and VERBOSE messages.
<li>it_sdesc converted into a function
<li>The code for reading DA6 files should now be endian independent.
<li>Descriptions with '$' symbols now print correctly.
